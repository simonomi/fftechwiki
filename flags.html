title: Flags
style: flags

<p>Flags are used to keep track of tons of different state throughout the game. This includes temporary state, like a dialogue choice or who won a battle, as well as long-lived state, like cleaning upgrades or story progress.</p>

<p>Flags are written like <code><local-value>&lt;<code-number>3 9</code-number>&gt;</local-value></code>, where the first number identifies the flag, and the second is a kind of 'type' (most likely). The main places they're used are in <a href="/fftechwiki/file-formats/DEX">DEX</a> and <a>DEP</a> files.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>Though we call them "types", it's not entirely clear what they're actually used for. The same ID with two different types <em>seems</em> to refer to the same flag<sup><a class="footnote-link" id="footnote-return:1" href="#footnote:1">1</a></sup>, but then why have the type at all? Meanwhile the <a href="/fftechwiki/file-formats/DEX">DEX</a> and <a>DEP</a> commands that deal with flags usually take the same 1 or 2 types every time, so clearly there's <em>some</em> significance.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that they aren't actually types at all. In their raw form, a flag looks like <code><local-value>&lt;<code-number>0x3000009</code-number>&gt;</local-value></code>, so it's not completely certain that these are two separate values. It's possible the 'type' is actually more of a 'category', and the usage patterns we see are for organizational reasons, not technical.</p>
