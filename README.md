A site for technical Fossil Fighters documentation

## Contributing
Because the site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), there's no built-in page editor.

#### Resources
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)
- [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (those `{{- -}}` and `{%- -%}` things)
- [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Tutorials/For_beginners/Getting_started) (how to write math formulas in HTML)

### Simple
1. Go to the page you want to edit
1. At the bottom, click the "Edit this page" link
1. Click the "Edit this file" button, and fork the repository if you need to
1. Edit the file to your satisfaction
1. Commit your changes
	1. Press the "Commit changes..." button
	1. Write a message explaining what you changed
	1. Press "Propose changes"
1. Create a pull request
	1. Press "Create pull request"
	1. Fill out the description if your change should have one
	1. Press "Create pull request"

### Advanced
If you want to preview your changes before you submit them, you'll need to [clone the repository locally](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and run `jekyll serve -o`. This is not advised unless you're already familiar with git, as you'll need to commit, push, and make a pull request for your changes manually.
