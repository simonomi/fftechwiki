<p>Index files are used to store files that share data without wasting space.</p>

<p>Certain types of files are often very similar to each other, like two characters sharing a 3D model, but with different textures and animations. Instead of storing copies of the shared data in each file, index files just have a list of indices, which point to where the actual data is stored.</p>

<p>These indices include a file name and a number (or list of numbers). The file name refers to a <a>MAR</a> file, and the number(s) refer to files within that archive. Usually, each index file uses the same table file for all indices.</p>

<p>Index files save a ton of space, but they're pretty annoying to work with, since you have to jump between mulitple files to see all the data.</p>
