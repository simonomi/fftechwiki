<p>There is only one RLS file, <code>etc/kaseki_defs</code>. It stores the data for every fossil rock in the game. Technically, there are 999 fossil rocks in the game, but 494 of them are blank, so there are really only 505.</p>

<table>

		{%- for fossil in site.data.RLS.fossils -%}
			<tr>
				<td class="bold text-align-center">{{ fossil.id }}</td>
				<td>{{ fossil.name }}</td>
				<td>{{ fossil.notes }}</td>
