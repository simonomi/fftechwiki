  "それではバトルを始めよう。",
  "左側がキミの陣、",
  "右側が敵側の陣だ。",
  "これがキミのリバイバーだ。彼らが戦う。",
  "そしてこれが敵のリバイバーだ。",
  "実際のバトルではリバイバー３体どうしで戦うが、今回はわかりやすくするために１体対1体で戦ってみよう。",
  "まず画面の見方について説明するよ。",
  "これはリバイバーのライフポイント（ＬＰ）を示すゲージだ。",
  "リバイバーのＬＰが0になると、リバイバーはバトルフィールドから消滅する。",
  "すべてのリバイバーをフィールドから消されてしまうと負けとなる。",
  "逆に、相手側のすべてのリバイバーをバトルフィールドから消し去った方が勝ちだ。",
  "次に、カセキパワー（ＫＰ）について説明しよう。",
  "これが現在のキミのカセキパワーだ。",
  "カセキパワーは、キミのリバイバーが行動する力のみなもとためのパワーだ。",
  "キミのリバイバーが攻撃をするなど、何か行動を起こす度にＫＰ消費されていく。",
  "それでは実際に戦ってみよう。",
  "バトルはターン制で進行する。先攻プレイヤーのターンが終わると、後攻プレイヤーのターンがやってくる。",
  "リバイバーのＬＰの合計値が低い方が先攻となる。",
  "ボクのリバイバーよりキミのリバイバーの方がＬＰが低いから、今回はキミが先攻だ。",
  "キミのターンがやってくると、まずキミのＫＰが一定値補充される。",
  "ここにある4つのコマンドアイコンは、キミがターン中に行うことができる行動を表している。",
  "１）リバイバーの情報を見ること",
  "２）リバイバーのワザを発動すること",
  "３）自分のターンを終了すること",
  "この３つだ。",
  "バトルフィールド上に自分のリバイバーが２体以上いるときは、交替というコマンドが使用できるが、",
  "今は交替できないから、説明はまた今度にするよ。",
  "とにかく、まずはワザを出して相手を攻撃してみよう。",
  "ワザコマンドアイコンを選んでみてごらん。",
  "（プレイヤーの入力待ち）",
  "そのアイコンじゃないよ。 ワザコマンドアイコンを選んでごらん。",
  "ワザコマンドを選ぶと、そのリバイバーが出すことができるワザのリストが表示される。",
  "これがワザの名前、",
  "これがそのワザを出すのに必要となるＫＰだ。",
  "現在の自分のＫＰより多くＫＰを消費するワザは発動することができないぞ。",
  "それでは好きなワザを選んでごらん。",
  "そのアイコンじゃないよ。 ワザコマンドアイコンを選んでごらん。",
  "ＯＫ。",
  "次は自分や敵のリバイバーの情報を見てみよう。",
  "情報コマンドを選んでごらん。",
  "そのアイコンじゃないよ。 情報コマンドアイコンを選んでごらん。",
  "ここでは、十字キーでカーソルを移動し、見たいリバイバーを選択する。",
  "自分だけでなく、敵のリバイバーの情報も見ることができる。",
  "ただし、敵リバイバーについて見られる情報は限られているぞ。",
  "自分のリバイバーについての情報は、ＬＲボタンでページを切り替えて見ることができるぞ。",
  "さて、それではキミのターンを終了しよう。",
  "自分のターンを終了するには、ターン終了アイコンを選ぶんだ。やってみてごらん。",
  "これでキミのターンは終了だ。次はボクのターンだよ。",
  "さあ、またキミのターンだ。",
  "あとは好きなように戦ってごらん。",
  "なかなかやるじゃないか。 その調子でどんどんバトルに挑戦していってくれたまえ。",
  "残念だったね。 でも何度もたたかっているうちに、きっとコツがつかめてくるよ。またいつでも挑戦しにおいで。",
